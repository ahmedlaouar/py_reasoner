The data in "bench_prepa/dataset.01/University0.owl" was generated from "ontologies/univ-bench/lubm-ex-20_disjoint.owl" using the Extended University Data Generator v0.1. It can be found alongside the Combo project from https://home.uni-leipzig.de/~clu/.
A copy of the EUGen-0.1 generator is given in this project.

The University0.db is an intermediate sqlite3 database with all the data in the form of statements (statements table) generated form the owl data file using the semantic-sql tool "https://pypi.org/project/semsql/".
